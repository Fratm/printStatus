# printStatus
Just a simple api call to octoprint to get the print status from the command line.

Yes I know I could have used the octoprint client command, but I did this to learn.  
I am still pretty new at python, so any chance I get to write something I do.

Anyways, this is not for public consumption, just there as an example for my self.
